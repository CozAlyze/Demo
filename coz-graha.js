/* ============================================================
   COZALYZE · COZ_GRAHA · shared graha glyph + life-cycle data module
   Used by current-life-cycle.html and current-season.html.

   Why this file exists: the repository carries no graha symbol assets of
   any kind. vedic-birth-chart.html renders bodies as two-letter
   abbreviations (Ke, Ve) and no SVG, PNG or glyph font for the nine
   grahas appears anywhere. Rather than add nine image files, every lord
   is drawn here once as inline SVG geometry using currentColor, so the
   copper tone comes from CSS and one component serves all nine.

   Nothing in this file is chart-specific. It reads whatever chart is in
   localStorage and exposes it; it never assumes a lord or a date.
