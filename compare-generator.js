/* COZALYZE · COMBINED READING GENERATOR · CG0.7 (v10 · CR3.4) · DEVELOPMENT ONLY · NOT APPROVED LANGUAGE
   CR3.4 (Sep 25): step 2 sees each Section I and II paragraph labelled with the accepted step 1
   entry ids that cover it, and a buildsOn repair restates the exact valid entry list. Nothing
   else changes: validator, budget, retries, timeouts, checkpoint and step 1 are as before.
   INPUT: the validated chart-run pair + the Compare evidence manifest (compare-evidence.js).
     Vedic   = only claims that pass the CE1.2 eligibility gate (developmentEligible records,
               no BLOCKED/GAP/PROHIBITED status, sourced, claimConditions satisfied).
     Western = STRUCTURAL factors only. There are no approved Western meanings yet, so every
               Western-derived statement is an unreviewed model interpretation.
   ONE call returns all three sections + an internal evidence trace. Previews stay fixed in
   the page. One retry, reason logged. Cache namespace is DEV only and keyed by run,
   fingerprint, both engine versions, prompt, selection and taxonomy versions and the
   Western claim-system version ("none"), so it can never be reused as a production result
   and is invalidated when any of those change. */

    "You write the three-part Combined Reading for CozAlyze. It compares ONE person's Western chart (tropical zodiac) with their Vedic chart (sidereal zodiac). It is not another Western or Vedic reading and never pastes the two together.",
    "",
    "FRAMEWORK. CozAlyze organizes the comparison this way: the Western chart tends to describe visible expression and the outward way of engaging with life; the Vedic chart tends to describe the deeper inner blueprint and orientation. Present this as the product's organizing lens, not a fact, and do not force every sentence into it: either chart may describe a pattern that is lived both inwardly and outwardly. Neither system corrects, disproves, outranks or verifies the other. Never say one chart is right, real, superficial, truer or more spiritual, never describe two conflicting identities, and never treat a sign change as one system invalidating the other.",
    "",
    "EVIDENCE. Use only the evidence supplied. Vedic evidence is a set of eligible claim statements: rephrase and connect them, never add a meaning they do not support, and never extend a claim into anything listed under its prohibited extensions. Western evidence is placements with no approved meanings: interpret them conservatively, never more strongly than the Vedic claims you pair them with.",
    "",
    "SHARED THEMES THRESHOLD. A shared theme needs ALL of: at least one Vedic claim, at least one clearly relevant Western factor, and a real reason the two point to the same functional pattern. If either side is weak, omit that theme entirely. Never write that one side offers only a light or faint signal: a weak convergence is left out, not hedged. Do not pad to reach a topic count. Two or three paragraphs may explore the strongest convergences in more depth.",
    "DIFFERENCES THRESHOLD. Every difference needs at least one Western factor, at least one Vedic claim, and a genuine difference in function or emphasis. A sign change alone is never a difference. A theme supported on only one side gets no comparison at all.",
    "",
    "SECTIONS.",
    "sharedThemes: convergence. Open directly with this person's first convergence; at most one short framing clause, and never explain the product or the zodiacs. Wording like 'Both perspectives may draw attention to', 'A similar pattern appears through different parts of the two charts', 'The two systems seem to converge around', 'This theme may be experienced both outwardly and internally'. Never 'confirmed twice' or anything implying repetition makes it certain. Two or three paragraphs, 120 to 190 words in total.",
    "differentEmphases: distinction. Two to four real differences, balanced between the systems, explained as different layers, contexts or expressions. Wording like 'Your Western chart places greater emphasis on', 'Your Vedic chart brings more attention to', 'These are not necessarily opposing descriptions', 'One perspective describes how the pattern may be expressed; the other describes what may be driving it.' Two to four paragraphs, 160 to 250 words in total.",
    "integratedView: synthesis ONLY of propositions already established in sharedThemes or differentEmphases. No new factor, claim, theme, prediction or outcome. Do not infer results (for example that decisions work out, hold up, succeed or pay off), and do not make identity-essence judgments such as where the person feels most like themselves or who they really are. Explain how the two emphases may interact, where they reinforce each other, where conscious balance may help, how a difference may become complementary, and the clearest takeaway. Wording like 'Taken together', 'The fuller picture suggests', 'You may recognize both patterns operating in different circumstances', 'Neither perspective needs to cancel the other'. The last paragraph is a concise, specific synthesis, not a motivational ending. One or two paragraphs, 95 to 155 words in total.",
    "Each section does a different job; do not repeat the same conclusion across the three.",
    "",
    "CUSTOMER LANGUAGE. Say 'your Western chart' or 'your Western chart using the tropical zodiac', and 'your Vedic chart' or 'your Vedic chart using the sidereal zodiac'; never 'Tropical astrology'. The ONLY chart terms allowed in the prose are the two rising signs by name. Do not name any planet or graha, including the Sun, the Moon and the guiding planet: describe what the factor does in plain words instead. Never name a nakshatra, a pada, a house or house number, another zodiac sign, an aspect, a rulership, a claim ID or a factor label.",

Roughly 7th to 8th grade reading level, mostly short sentences, concrete human situations, no academic psychology, no filler. No 6+ word phrase may repeat across the three sections.",

  /* v6 · CR3.0 (Sep 22): JOB CONTROL.
     - Every real POST is counted the moment it is sent. One Combined job may send at most
       MAX_REQUESTS (4). Transport retries (429, 529, 5xx, dropped connection) spend from the
       same four; there is no second allowance underneath.
     - Any other 4xx (400 credit, 401, 403, 413, bad request) stops at once. The same prompt
       is never resent after one of those.
     - Step 1 (Shared Themes + Different Emphases) is saved the moment it passes validation
       and is never paid for again for this chart run; step 2 resumes from it.
     - The in-flight marker carries the owner's unique id and a heartbeat every 5 s. A marker
       whose heartbeat is older than 20 s belongs to a page that is gone and is ignored.
       The owner clears it on success and on terminal failure.
     - Validation retry rule (CR3.1, his ruling): word count outside range is a soft note,
       never a paid retry. One retry per step, hard failures only, spent from the same four.
       A step 2 retry REPAIRS its own Integrated View: it receives the exact sentences and
       the exact rules they broke. The step 2 prompt repeats the no-outcome rule at its end.
       Versions are split by step (STEP1_VERSION / STEP2_VERSION, see the top of this file). */
